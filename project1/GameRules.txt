Hello IT3038C Student/Professor!

Welcome to the game Higher or Lower!

The objective of the game is simple: Guess whether the next number is lower
than the previous one.

The more you can guess correctly in a row, the better!

To run the script, type 'py project1code' and the instructions on how to play
the game will follow.



The goal of the script is to both demonstrate my amateur understanding of
Python, as well as apply some of the lessons we learned during the Python
segment of our work. Plus, I wanted to make a fun and challenging game!

I hope you enjoy the game! Script on, Bearcats!
